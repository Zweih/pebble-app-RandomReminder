RandomTimer. 
Countdown timer with random interval.
Useful for board or party games (like hot potato) with reaction. Also may used in some other practice where you need a countdown that will expire after a randomized amount of time and without the knowing how much time is remaining.
You can set:
- Minimum and Maximum time values, that will be used when randomly picking a starting and ending time.
- Vibration pattern ( once or solid ).
- Auto repeat (relaunch timer) after time remaining.
Support rectangle and round display.
